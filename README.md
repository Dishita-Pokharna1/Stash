# STASH
# Opportunity Organizer ‚Äî Don't Just Save, ACT!

> ‚ÄúIn a world drowning in DMs, screenshots, and half-read posts... we built the lifeboat.‚Äù

##  Overview

Social media is overflowing with golden opportunities‚Äîjobs, hackathons, scholarships, blogs. But they vanish in the scroll. We screenshot them, save them to WhatsApp, maybe forward them to friends... and then? Forgotten.

**We‚Äôre changing that.**  
This app lets you seamlessly **save, categorize, and act** on these posts,with the power of AI and reminders baked right in.

##  What Problem Are We Solving?

Traditional bookmarking tools don't:
- Set reminders for deadlines
- Classify content intelligently
- Work directly from social platforms
- Offer productivity dashboards

That‚Äôs where we come in.

## **Demo Video ‚Äî See It in Action**
Watch how STASH turns chaos into opportunity gold.  
From saving a post to setting a reminder, it‚Äôs all smooth, smart, and satisfying.
